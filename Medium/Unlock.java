/*
Shekhar is a bomb defusal specialist. He once encountered a bomb that can be defused only by a secret code. He is given a number N and a number K. 
And he is also given permutation of first N natural numbers . The defusal code is the largest permutation possible by doing atmost K swaps among a pair of 
the given permutation. Help him to find the final permutation.

Input Format
First line contains â€‹an integer N and an integer k. The next line contains N space separated integers denoting the given permutation.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 10^5
1<= K <= 10^9

Output Format
The final permutation of the numbers with every number separated by a space with other number.

Sample Input
5 2
3 4 1 2 5
Sample Output
5 4 3 2 1

Explanation
First we can swap 5 with 3 which gives us 5 4 1 2 3 and then we can swap 3 and 1 which gives us 5 4 3 2 1.
