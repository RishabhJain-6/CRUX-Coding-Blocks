/*
Take as input N, the size of array. Take N more inputs and store that in an array. 
Take as input “target”, a number. Write a function which prints all triplets of numbers which sum to target.

Input Format
First line contains input N.
Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.
The third line contains a single integer T denoting the target element.

Constraints
Length of Array should be between 1 and 1000.

Output Format
Print all the triplet present in the array in a new line each. 
The triplets must be printed as A, B and C where A,B and C are the elements of the triplet ( A<=B<=C) and all triplets must be printed in sorted order. 
Print only unique triplets.

Sample Input
9
5 7 9 1 2 4 6 8 3
10
Sample Output
1, 2 and 7
1, 3 and 6
1, 4 and 5
2, 3 and 5

Explanation
Array = {5, 7, 9, 1, 2, 4, 6 ,8 ,3}. Target number = 10. Find any three number in the given array which sum to target number.
